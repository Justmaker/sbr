MAP calculation in sql :
rÃ©f : https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/MeanAveragePrecision

- n main parameter
- has bought = 1 if user bought the product else 0
- row number = predicted rank. No ties. 

- demo of random is easy, just consider all permutation and everything got same chance to be at any place => bouyah
