NDCG calculation in sql :
r√©f : http://www.kaggle.com/wiki/NormalizedDiscountedCumulativeGain

- rel is here in {0,1,2}
- ora is the optimal rank
- mra is the predicted rank

- generalization of formula are easy
- randomNDCG proof is simple : think permutation and realize that each line appears a constant nb of times at each position. 

-- case , rel in {0,1}
E(nDCG) = ((K/p)*sum(1/log2(i+1))) / IDCG
with K = sum(rel_i), p = length of list
IDCG = sum_i=1^K(1/log2(i+1))

-- case , rel in {0,1,2}
E(nDCG) = ((K1/p)*sum(1/log2(i+1))+(K2/p)*sum(3/log2(i+1))) / IDCG
K1 = nb rel = 1, k2 = nb rel = 2, p length of list
IDCG = sum_i=1^K2(3/log2(i+1)) + sum_i=K2+1^K2+k1(1/log2(i+1))

-- case rel in k (sorted list, asc) of size L, first index 1.
Lj is size of rel = kj
E(nDCG) = (sum_j((kj/p)*sum(2^kj -1 /log2(i+1)))) / IDCG
IDCG = sum_j(sum_i=1^K2(2^(k_(L-j))/log2(i+sum_(l<j)(kl)+1)))
