NDCG calculation in sql :
r√©f : http://www.kaggle.com/wiki/NormalizedDiscountedCumulativeGain

- rel is here in {0,1,2}
- ora is the optimal rank
- mra is the predicted rank

- generalization of formula are easy
- randomNDCG proof is simple : think permutation and realize that each line appears a constant nb of times at each position.
